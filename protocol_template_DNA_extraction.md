## BACKGROUND

This document describes the required protocol to conduct [insert name of the method/protocol].

### Summary

Insert a short description of the background for the method/protocol (e.g. why and for which purpose do you perform water sampling).
Please provide a brief summary of your method including, as appropriate, a brief description of what techniques your best practice is about, which ocean environments or regions it targets, the primary sensors covered, what type of data/measurements/observing platform it covers, limits to its applicability.

### Method Description and Rationale

Insert a short description of the functioning principal of the methodology used in the protocol (i.e. how does the method work?). Please note that this is different from the step-by-step description of the protocol procedure.
Insert a short statement explaining why the specific methodology used in the protocol has been selected (e.g. it is highly reproducible, highly accurate, procedures are easy to execute etcâ€¦.).

### Spatial Coverage and Environment(s) of Relevance

If applicable, please specify the region where the protocol is applied. For regional term guidance see the [GAZ ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/gaz). If applicable, please indicate here the environment(s) of relevance for the protocol, e.g. Abyssal plain. Select from the [ENVO ontology](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/envo).
