# Protocol collection templates

This repository contains protocol templates for biomolecular ocean observing. The templates were developed on the basis of the NEON and AWI protocol templates, and adapted for the purpose of capturing metagenomic ocean observing workflows. 

This repository is maintained by the Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP) group coming out of the [Task Team 21-03: Omics/eDNA Protocol Management](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org/about/task-teams/obps-task-team-21-03-omics-edna-protocol-management/) under the Ocean Best Practices System.

### Aim and Scope
We aim to achieve increased comparability between Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BOPs). Currently, the wealth of ocean biomolecular practices is shared in diverse formats (e.g. text in publications, pdfs). To allow the community to understand differences in practices and the potential for integrating the data generated using the BOPs, we intend to offer further standardization via the development of templates (cf. DA3). These will allow both humans and machines to more efficiently (or at all) log and compare protocols at scale.
