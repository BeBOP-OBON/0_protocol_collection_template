# Protocol collection templates

This repository contains protocol templates for biomolecular ocean observing. The templates were developed on the basis of the NEON and AWI protocol templates, and adapted for the purpose of capturing metagenomic ocean observing workflows. 

This repository is maintained by the Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP) group coming out of the [Task Team 21-03: Omics/eDNA Protocol Management](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org/about/task-teams/obps-task-team-21-03-omics-edna-protocol-management/) under the Ocean Best Practices System.

## Aim and Scope
We aim to achieve increased comparability between Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BOPs). Currently, the wealth of ocean biomolecular practices is shared in diverse formats (e.g. text in publications, pdfs, ...). To allow the community to understand differences in practices and the potential for integrating the data generated using the BOPs, we intend to offer means of standardization via the development of the templates found in this repository. These will allow humans to more efficiently (or at all) log and compare protocols at scale.

## How to use the content of this repository

### Exploring the protocol templates
This repository currently contains protocol templates for the following steps of an omics observation:
- [Sampling](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_sampling.md)
- [DNA extraction](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_DNA_extraction.md)
- [PCR and clean up](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_PCR.md)
- [Sequencing](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_sequencing.md)
- [In-silico analysis](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_insilico_analysis.md)

All protocol templates follow a similar structure: General metadata on top, followed by sections on background, personnel required, and equipment required. Next, you will find a section on the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), which should be used to report on the exact steps taken as part of executing a protocol. In the template for insilico analysis, in place of the SOP, there is a Guide to the archived methodology and a section on Archive content. The templates conclude with References and Appendices.

Note, that the protocol-level metadata is to be reported as part of the protocol in the section [TO_BE_ADDED] following the Minimum Information about an Omic Protocol (MIOP). For more information and guidance on MIOP, please consult the [MIOP repository](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/miop) in this organisation.

### Forking the repository to use the protocol templates

**To use the templates, and apply them to your own protocols, please fork this repository.**
