# Protocol collection templates

This repository contains protocol templates for biomolecular ocean observing. The templates were developed on the basis of the NEON and AWI protocol templates, and adapted for the purpose of capturing metagenomic ocean observing workflows. 

This repository is maintained by the Better Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BeBOP) group coming out of the [Task Team 21-03: Omics/eDNA Protocol Management](https://www.oceanbestpractices.org/about/task-teams/obps-task-team-21-03-omics-edna-protocol-management/) under the Ocean Best Practices System.

### Aim and Scope
We aim to achieve increased comparability between Biomolecular Ocean Practices (BOPs). Currently, the wealth of ocean biomolecular practices is shared in diverse formats (e.g. text in publications, pdfs). To allow the community to understand differences in practices and the potential for integrating the data generated using the BOPs, we intend to offer further standardization via the development of templates (cf. DA3). These will allow both humans and machines to more efficiently (or at all) log and compare protocols at scale.

### How to use the content of this repository
This repository currently contains protocol templates for the following steps of an omics observation:
- [Sampling](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_sampling.md)
- [DNA extraction](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_DNA_extraction.md)
- [PCR and clean up](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_PCR.md)
- [Sequencing](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_sequencing.md)
- [In-silico analysis](https://github.com/BeBOP-OBON/0_protocol_collection_template/blob/main/protocol_template_insilico_analysis.md)

All protocol templates follow a similar structure, and should be used to report on the exact steps taken as part of executing a protocol.

This only contains the templates. **To use the templates, please fork this repository.**
